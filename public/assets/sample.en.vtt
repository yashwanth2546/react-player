1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,384
They're weird, fuzzy and

2
00:00:02,422 --> 00:00:03,620
in a lot of trouble.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,988
These insects are

4
00:00:05,014 --> 00:00:06,660
actually all bees, wild

5
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,148
ones. And they're

6
00:00:08,183 --> 00:00:09,212
debatably more important

7
00:00:09,286 --> 00:00:10,188
than the honeymaking

8
00:00:10,224 --> 00:00:11,840
kind. People are really

9
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,528
worried about bees for

10
00:00:14,554 --> 00:00:16,844
honeybee for granted, at

11
00:00:16,882 --> 00:00:18,392
our own peril. But what

12
00:00:18,406 --> 00:00:19,640
most people don't know,

13
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:20,648
honeybee numbers are

14
00:00:20,674 --> 00:00:21,960
increasing worldwide.

15
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,252
Not just that, but the

16
00:00:23,266 --> 00:00:24,804
way humans use honeybees

17
00:00:24,852 --> 00:00:26,290
makes them a problem.

18
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:27,912
Putting a honeybee hive

19
00:00:27,936 --> 00:00:29,124
in your backyard doesn't

20
00:00:29,172 --> 00:00:32,384
help because we're saving

21
00:00:32,421 --> 00:00:33,440
the wrong bees.

22
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,612
Animals are involved in

23
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:44,352
the pollination of 90% of

24
00:00:44,366 --> 00:00:45,208
the world's flowering

25
00:00:45,244 --> 00:00:46,512
plants. And when you

26
00:00:46,526 --> 00:00:47,584
think of pollinators,

27
00:00:47,692 --> 00:00:48,660
the honeybee probably

28
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,332
comes to mind. That's

29
00:00:50,356 --> 00:00:51,288
because honeybees and

30
00:00:51,314 --> 00:00:52,324
humans have an ancient

31
00:00:52,372 --> 00:00:53,892
relationship. Bees have

32
00:00:53,906 --> 00:00:54,564
been managed for

33
00:00:54,602 --> 00:00:55,800
thousands of years.

34
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:57,232
There's a lot of evidence

35
00:00:57,316 --> 00:00:58,968
that played an important

36
00:00:59,054 --> 00:01:00,520
role also in the ancient

37
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,112
cultures in Egypt and

38
00:01:02,186 --> 00:01:05,004
Greece, beekeeping has

39
00:01:05,042 --> 00:01:05,760
always been very

40
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,632
widespread. Axel is the

00:01:07,646 --> 00:01:08,728

Conservation Committee at

43
00:01:09,866 --> 00:01:11,040
the IUCN.

44
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,184
Honeybees are native to

45
00:01:14,222 --> 00:01:16,072
Asia, Europe and Africa,

46
00:01:16,156 --> 00:01:17,064
but nowadays are

47
00:01:17,102 --> 00:01:17,824
everywhere except

48
00:01:17,872 --> 00:01:20,572
Antarctica. APIs Melissa

49
00:01:20,596 --> 00:01:21,480
is the most common

50
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:22,524
honeybee and the best

51
00:01:22,562 --> 00:01:23,808
studied. Although there

52
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:24,928
are another ten known

53
00:01:24,964 --> 00:01:26,520
species, they're general

54
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:27,672
pollinators, meaning they

55
00:01:27,686 --> 00:01:28,560
will pollinate most

56
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:29,824
plants. And although

57
00:01:29,872 --> 00:01:31,072
honey bees are at risk

58
00:01:31,096 --> 00:01:32,308
from pests and disease,

59
00:01:32,404 --> 00:01:33,364
the number of colonies

60
00:01:33,412 --> 00:01:34,524
worldwide is actually

61
00:01:34,622 --> 00:01:36,348
growing. According to the

62
00:01:36,374 --> 00:01:38,208
FAO, managed hives have

63
00:01:38,234 --> 00:01:39,348
increased worldwide by

64
00:01:39,374 --> 00:01:41,916
83% since 1960. 1%

65
00:01:42,038 --> 00:01:43,490
because they are always

66
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,496
managed by the beekeepers

67
00:01:45,568 --> 00:01:47,320
and also receive

68
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,732
veterinary treatment and

69
00:01:48,746 --> 00:01:50,644
so on, there's no risk

70
00:01:50,692 --> 00:01:51,816
that they will become

71
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:53,500
extinct. But honeybees

72
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,976
aren't the only bees.

73
00:01:55,168 --> 00:01:56,760
The general public

74
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,508
confounds bees with the

75
00:01:59,534 --> 00:02:00,972
honeybees. This is

specializing in urban

79
00:02:04,444 --> 00:02:05,808
environments. It would be

80
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,560
the same situation if,

81
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:08,604
for example, you were

82
00:02:08,642 --> 00:02:10,644
talking about birds. And

83
00:02:10,681 --> 00:02:11,988
people think that when

84
00:02:12,014 --> 00:02:13,108
you talk about birds,

85
00:02:13,144 --> 00:02:14,640
you talk about chickens.

86
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,572
They're around 20,000

87
00:02:16,646 --> 00:02:17,764
different species of wild

88
00:02:17,812 --> 00:02:19,152
bees and they are the

89
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:20,068
most important wild

90
00:02:20,104 --> 00:02:21,352
pollinators. They're

91
00:02:21,376 --> 00:02:22,764
mostly solitary. And

92
00:02:22,802 --> 00:02:23,928
unlike honey, bees are

93
00:02:23,954 --> 00:02:24,840
suited to specific

94
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,268
plants, which makes them

95
00:02:26,294 --> 00:02:26,892
much better at

96
00:02:26,906 --> 00:02:29,988
pollinating. A hectare of

97
00:02:30,014 --> 00:02:30,984
apples, for example,

98
00:02:31,082 --> 00:02:32,544
would require tens of

99
00:02:32,582 --> 00:02:33,948
thousands of honeybees to

100
00:02:33,974 --> 00:02:34,980
pollinate, but only

101
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,184
hundreds of this wild

102
00:02:36,232 --> 00:02:37,588
bee. Because osmia

103
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:38,884
cornuta is particularly

104
00:02:38,932 --> 00:02:39,568
good at apple

105
00:02:39,604 --> 00:02:41,052
pollination. Each

106
00:02:41,126 --> 00:02:43,908
flowering plant is

107
00:02:43,994 --> 00:02:45,864
strongly connected to a

108
00:02:45,902 --> 00:02:48,028
pollinator that fits

109
00:02:48,124 --> 00:02:50,044
accordingly to the lock

110
00:02:50,092 --> 00:02:51,912

00:02:58,154 --> 00:03:00,540
fit between flower and

118
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,632
is the product of an

119
00:03:04,826 --> 00:03:07,608
ongoing coal evolution on

120
00:03:07,694 --> 00:03:10,524
for centuries that is

121
00:03:10,562 --> 00:03:12,972
still uprising like the

122
00:03:12,986 --> 00:03:13,992
squash bees native to

123
00:03:14,006 --> 00:03:14,728
Central and South

124
00:03:14,764 --> 00:03:16,468
America, they're

125
00:03:16,504 --> 00:03:17,412
perfectly suited to

126
00:03:17,426 --> 00:03:18,712
squash plants. They're

127
00:03:18,736 --> 00:03:19,948
early risers and squash

128
00:03:19,984 --> 00:03:21,156
flowers are only open

129
00:03:21,218 --> 00:03:22,116
early in the morning

130
00:03:22,238 --> 00:03:23,172
while the honeybees are

131
00:03:23,186 --> 00:03:25,008
still asleep. Don't like

132
00:03:25,034 --> 00:03:26,304
squash? How about

133
00:03:26,342 --> 00:03:27,432
tomatoes, potatoes or

134
00:03:27,446 --> 00:03:28,948
eggplant? These crops

135
00:03:28,984 --> 00:03:29,644
also need wild

136
00:03:29,692 --> 00:03:31,104
pollinators. Loud ones

137
00:03:31,142 --> 00:03:32,112
like bumblebees to be

138
00:03:32,126 --> 00:03:33,532
precise. Their flowers

139
00:03:33,556 --> 00:03:34,852
require a vibrating buzz

140
00:03:34,876 --> 00:03:36,016
to release their pollen,

141
00:03:36,088 --> 00:03:37,012
something a bumblebee

142
00:03:37,036 --> 00:03:38,400
perfectly provides.

143
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,068
Honeybees just don't have

144
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:42,256
that skill but wild bees

145
00:03:42,328 --> 00:03:44,160
are in serious decline.

146
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,584
And this doesn't only

147
00:03:47,622 --> 00:03:48,640
affect them and their

148
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,464
ecosystems, but our food

149
00:03:50,502 --> 00:03:51,870
security as well.

150
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,092
Worldwide, wild bee

151
00:03:54,116 --> 00:03:54,868
diversity has been

152
00:03:54,894 --> 00:03:55,924
decreasing each year

153
00:03:55,962 --> 00:03:57,472
since the 1990s.

154
00:03:57,606 --> 00:03:59,060
Pesticides intensive

155
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,244
agriculture and

156
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:01,724
especially habitat loss

157
00:04:01,772 --> 00:04:03,892
are mean drivers. A

158
00:04:03,906 --> 00:04:04,972
recent study found that

159
00:04:04,986 --> 00:04:06,068
we may have already lost

160
00:04:06,104 --> 00:04:07,352
a quarter of wild bee

161
00:04:07,376 --> 00:04:08,588
species. But assessment

162
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:09,692
is hard due to the lack

163
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:11,456
of global data. Various

164
00:04:11,528 --> 00:04:12,440
regional estimates

165
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,564
suggest over 40% of wild

166
00:04:14,612 --> 00:04:15,824
bee and butterfly species

167
00:04:15,872 --> 00:04:17,312
are threatened. Farmers

168
00:04:17,336 --> 00:04:18,471
are already noticing a

169
00:04:18,486 --> 00:04:19,576
difference. When they

170
00:04:19,637 --> 00:04:22,348
walked along, everything

171
00:04:22,434 --> 00:04:24,596
was full of pollinators.

172
00:04:24,788 --> 00:04:26,944
And nowadays it's more

173
00:04:26,982 --> 00:04:29,612
like everything is calmed

174
00:04:29,696 --> 00:04:33,020
down and nobody knows

175
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,288
where they are. This loss

176
00:04:35,324 --> 00:04:36,400
of diversity can cause

177
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,684
knock on effects on whole

178
00:04:37,722 --> 00:04:39,160
ecosystems. Less

179
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,244
pollinator diversity

180
00:04:40,292 --> 00:04:41,900
means fewer wild plants.

181
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,160
This can hurt animals

182
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,464
that use them for food or

183
00:04:44,502 --> 00:04:46,600
shelter. And it's also

184
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:47,884
bad for the future of our

185
00:04:47,922 --> 00:04:48,510
food.

186
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,708
The yield of filtered to

187
00:04:53,734 --> 00:04:56,084
stem is higher when there

188
00:04:56,122 --> 00:04:58,808
are visits by variety of

189
00:04:58,894 --> 00:05:00,368
clean eaters compared to

190
00:05:00,394 --> 00:05:01,760
when they are visited by

191
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,596
only honeybees. Remember

192
00:05:03,658 --> 00:05:05,208
Osmia Cornucha, the apple

193
00:05:05,244 --> 00:05:06,908
specialist? Most of the

194
00:05:06,934 --> 00:05:08,988
planation of apple trees

195
00:05:09,024 --> 00:05:11,184
is performed by several

196
00:05:11,232 --> 00:05:13,808
species of wild bees. So

197
00:05:13,954 --> 00:05:15,200
if you don't get this

198
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,916
wild bees, you get apples

199
00:05:17,988 --> 00:05:19,820
that would be reduced.

200
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,256
US. Crops are already

201
00:05:22,318 --> 00:05:23,372
producing less due to

202
00:05:23,386 --> 00:05:24,900
wild pollinator decline.

203
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,376
And globally, we're

204
00:05:26,388 --> 00:05:27,812
planting more and more of

205
00:05:27,826 --> 00:05:28,824
the crops that require

206
00:05:28,872 --> 00:05:30,200
animal pollination, like

207
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,988
fruits, vegetables and

208
00:05:32,014 --> 00:05:33,588
oil seeds. The increase

209
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:34,944
in honeybees hasn't kept

210
00:05:34,992 --> 00:05:36,708
up. This means pollinator

211
00:05:36,744 --> 00:05:37,788
dependence has increased

212
00:05:37,824 --> 00:05:40,076
around 70% since 1061.

213
00:05:40,078 --> 00:05:42,332
And combined with the

214
00:05:42,346 --> 00:05:43,008
decline in wild

215
00:05:43,044 --> 00:05:44,492
pollinators, means an

216
00:05:44,506 --> 00:05:45,588
emergency for the global

217
00:05:45,624 --> 00:05:46,808
food supply. This is

218
00:05:46,834 --> 00:05:47,768
especially true in

219
00:05:47,794 --> 00:05:48,920
countries with many large

220
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,784
monocultures that destroy

221
00:05:50,832 --> 00:05:52,212
wild pollinator habitats

222
00:05:52,296 --> 00:05:53,576
like China and the United

223
00:05:53,638 --> 00:05:55,844
States. Not only that,

224
00:05:56,002 --> 00:05:57,420
the way we use honeybees

225
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,532
actually makes them a

226
00:05:58,546 --> 00:05:59,672
part of the problem.

227
00:05:59,866 --> 00:06:01,064
According to the American

228
00:06:01,162 --> 00:06:02,568
Beekeeping Federation,

229
00:06:02,724 --> 00:06:04,616
two thirds of the 2.7

230
00:06:04,678 --> 00:06:05,868
million honeybee colonies

231
00:06:05,904 --> 00:06:07,052
in the US. Are used for

232
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:09,572
pollination. Most go to

233
00:06:09,586 --> 00:06:10,568
the almond fields in

234
00:06:10,594 --> 00:06:12,512
California, where 80% of

235
00:06:12,526 --> 00:06:13,508
the world's almonds come

236
00:06:13,534 --> 00:06:14,952
from. Then bees rotate

237
00:06:14,976 --> 00:06:15,752
around the country to

238
00:06:15,766 --> 00:06:17,292
pollinate other crops.

239
00:06:17,436 --> 00:06:18,560
Nowhere else in the world

240
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:19,628
uses honey bees for

241
00:06:19,654 --> 00:06:21,128
pollination like the US.

242
00:06:21,274 --> 00:06:22,512
But the trend is growing

243
00:06:22,536 --> 00:06:23,904
in Europe too, as wild

244
00:06:23,952 --> 00:06:25,428
pollinators disappear.

245
00:06:25,584 --> 00:06:26,864
Unfortunately, it's not

246
00:06:26,902 --> 00:06:27,512
so good for the

247
00:06:27,526 --> 00:06:28,712
honeybees. They can be

248
00:06:28,726 --> 00:06:29,784
exposed to pesticides

249
00:06:29,832 --> 00:06:31,152
from the crops or catch

250
00:06:31,176 --> 00:06:32,108
diseases from the other

251
00:06:32,134 --> 00:06:33,308
colonies. And these

252
00:06:33,334 --> 00:06:34,352
honeybees are also a

253
00:06:34,366 --> 00:06:35,480
threat to wild ones.

254
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,644
Within a honeybee hive,

255
00:06:37,692 --> 00:06:39,260
you have tens of

256
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,716
thousands of individuals

257
00:06:40,788 --> 00:06:43,484
that need a lot of food.

258
00:06:43,582 --> 00:06:45,512
There will need most of

259
00:06:45,526 --> 00:06:46,944
the floral resources,

260
00:06:47,052 --> 00:06:48,284
and there will not be

261
00:06:48,322 --> 00:06:50,816
enough left for the other

262
00:06:50,938 --> 00:06:52,748
polynesian species. If

263
00:06:52,774 --> 00:06:54,968
you have many bees, then

264
00:06:54,994 --> 00:06:55,748
they will probably

265
00:06:55,834 --> 00:06:57,900
outcompete the native.

266
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,590
Speed is very fast.

267
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,368
Honeybees can also spread

268
00:07:01,404 --> 00:07:02,948
disease to wild bees. An

269
00:07:02,974 --> 00:07:04,088
infected bee can leave

270
00:07:04,114 --> 00:07:05,672
some virus on a flower to

271
00:07:05,686 --> 00:07:06,824
be picked up by the next

272
00:07:06,862 --> 00:07:08,988
wild bee that visits it's

273
00:07:09,024 --> 00:07:10,464
not the honeybees fault.

274
00:07:10,572 --> 00:07:11,652
But save the bees

275
00:07:11,736 --> 00:07:12,980
definitely does not mean

276
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,108
adding more into the

277
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:16,136
environment. There have

278
00:07:16,198 --> 00:07:17,840
been a lot of people that

279
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,616
thought that they could

280
00:07:19,678 --> 00:07:22,100
only save the bees when

281
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:25,020
having their own beehives

282
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,684
in the backyard. And

283
00:07:26,722 --> 00:07:28,750
that's the wrong way to

284
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,688
conserve pollinators. So

285
00:07:31,714 --> 00:07:32,720
what's the right way?

286
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,232
Industrial agriculture is

287
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:35,504
the biggest threat to all

288
00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:37,164
bees. It uses harmful

289
00:07:37,212 --> 00:07:38,504
chemicals and relies on

290
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:40,188
huge fields of one crop.

291
00:07:40,344 --> 00:07:41,588
Ideally, we change our

292
00:07:41,614 --> 00:07:42,992
whole food system. But on

293
00:07:43,006 --> 00:07:43,892
a personal level,

294
00:07:43,966 --> 00:07:45,084
supporting small scale,

295
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,448
sustainable farmers, if

296
00:07:46,474 --> 00:07:48,048
viable, also supports

297
00:07:48,084 --> 00:07:49,268
divorced habitats. For

298
00:07:49,294 --> 00:07:51,092
wild bees, even more can

299
00:07:51,106 --> 00:07:52,320
be done with a backyard,

300
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,304
like leaving native

301
00:07:53,352 --> 00:07:54,588
plants alone or planting

302
00:07:54,624 --> 00:07:56,388
new ones. Open sunny

303
00:07:56,424 --> 00:07:58,064
ground or dead logs also

304
00:07:58,102 --> 00:07:59,244
make great breeding spots

305
00:07:59,292 --> 00:08:00,884
for wild bees. But most

306
00:08:00,922 --> 00:08:02,264
of all, they need more

307
00:08:02,302 --> 00:08:03,440
attention. We need

308
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,472
honeybees that aren't in

309
00:08:04,486 --> 00:08:05,588
danger of losing them.

310
00:08:05,674 --> 00:08:06,672
With wild bees, it's

311
00:08:06,696 --> 00:08:07,630
another story.

312
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,636
Did you have any idea why

313
00:08:12,698 --> 00:08:14,868
bees were that cool? I am

314
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,072
in love with Ozmia

315
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:17,824
Cornuta. That applebee.

316
00:08:17,932 --> 00:08:21,084
It's so cute. Anyway,

317
00:08:21,182 --> 00:08:22,188
don't forget to like the

318
